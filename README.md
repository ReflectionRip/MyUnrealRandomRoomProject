# MyUnrealRandomRoomProject
A random room selector in unreal engine 4.

This map has a trigger box that will pull one of 2 random maps into the doorway, resulting in a near infinite map of random rooms.

Bugs:

1. After a certain distance from the center of the map, the navmesh will stop working.  It has a limited range.
2. Rooms may spawn over each other resulting in a blocked passageway.
